<h2>Kena Mobile Operator Unlock Script</h2>
<p>>A robust UserScript (for Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey) designed to dynamically add all known Italian mobile operators to the port-in selection menu and hidden validation inputs on Kena Mobile's product pages (/prodotto/*). This script uses a MutationObserver to ensure the added operators persist, even when the page's own JavaScript attempts to overwrite the menu.</p>

<h3>⚠️ Warning/Disclaimer:</h3> This script only modifies your local browser experience by adjusting the HTML form data. 
<p>Its use is primarily intended for testing and personal analysis. 
Kena Mobile's port-in process is subject to their internal business rules and server-side validation. 
Use of this script to bypass official processes is entirely at the user's own risk, and the author assumes no responsibility for any consequences, errors, or service interruptions that may arise from its use. Use responsibly or, even better, do not use.</p>
